Hello, I am Farida Niftaliyeva, the proud owner of Zest Cosmetics. My mission in establishing this brand is to empower women in Azerbaijan by providing them with access to a diverse range of makeup brands from around the world. My ultimate vision is to build a brick-and-mortar store, where individuals can immerse themselves in a unique shopping experienceâ€”having the opportunity to test and try products before making a purchase.
Zest Cosmetics aims to go beyond being a mere makeup destination; it aspires to create a vibrant and supportive community. This community will not only celebrate beauty but also encourage self-expression and confidence. By fostering a space where individuals can connect, share beauty tips, and explore the latest trends, Zest Cosmetics seeks to become a hub for beauty enthusiasts and a go-to resource for makeup lovers in Azerbaijan.
